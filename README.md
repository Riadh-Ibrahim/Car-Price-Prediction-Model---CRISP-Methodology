# Car Price Prediction Model - CRISP Methodology

This project applies the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to build a car price prediction model. The model predicts car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other attributes.

## Project Overview
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following phases:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define the objectives and plan the prediction of car prices.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collect and explore data from various sources, identifying important features for the model.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Apply machine learning algorithms to predict car prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and make improvements.
6. **Deployment**: Prepare the model for deployment to real-world applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riadh-Ibrahim/Car-Price-Prediction-Model---CRISP-Methodology.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (using pip for Python):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Prepare your data according to the specifications in the `data` folder.
2. Train the model using the `train_model.py` script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.
